    <p>Group tours also follow a fixed and pre-arranged itinerary. They often only take place depending on the number of travelers i.e. they require a certain number of travelers in order to go ahead or it becomes a financial cost rather than profitable. It is also worth noting there are a maximum number of travelers on group tours too, as determined by the mode of transport – a 56 seater coach can accommodate no more passengers and therefore the number limit is defined. Group tours are generally always escorted or a tour guide service is provided.
